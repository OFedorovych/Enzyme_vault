It is a protocol for people or entities to manage their wealth & the wealth of others within a customizable and safe environment.

## Install

### Prerequisites

- [node](https://www.nodejs.org)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)

```sh
git clone [GIT_REPOSITORY_URL]
cd protocol
pnpm install
```

## Compile contracts

```sh
pnpm compile
```

## Test

First, create a `.env` file by copying `.env.example`. Input your Ethereum node endpoint info as-needed (generally, only setting `ETHEREUM_NODE_MAINNET` is fine).

Then, you can run tests. The full test suite can be run with:

```sh
pnpm test
```

Note that tests might fail on the first runs while building a cache for the fork block, due to timeout. Continue to run tests as-needed, which will build the cache.
